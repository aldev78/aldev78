- 👋 Hi, I’m @aldev78
- 👀 I am in the process of retraining to become a developer. I have 15 years of experience in the field of laboratory and quality management 
  and I was able to practice VB code on Access and Excel interfaces. I have knowledge in the use of databases. I am passionate about computer-assisted music 
  and music production in general, so one day I'd like to work on music software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Python open source project where I could give some help with my beginner skills
- 📫 How to reach me : al.dev.python@gmail.com
